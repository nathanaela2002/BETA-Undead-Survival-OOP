# Undead Survival

## Overview
Undead Survival is a 2D survival game developed in Java using the Swing framework. In this game, players navigate through various levels while battling hordes of undead to survive. The game combines strategic gameplay with dynamic interactions to provide an engaging player experience.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Players must use strategy and quick reflexes to avoid and defeat waves of undead enemies.
- **Interactive Environments:** Each level offers unique challenges and environments that respond to player actions.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** The game increases in complexity and difficulty as the player advances, offering a challenging yet rewarding experience.

## Implementation Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Undead Survival exemplifies core OOP principles, making the game not only functional but also modular and easy to extend:
- **Encapsulation:** Game logic is wrapped in classes such as `Player`, `Enemy`, `GamePanel`, etc., each managing its own state and behaviors.
- **Inheritance:** Common functionalities of game elements are generalized in base classes, which specialized classes extend to add or modify behaviors. This allows for code reusability and extension without modification.
- **Polymorphism:** The game utilizes polymorphic behavior, particularly in rendering and event handling, to interact with different game elements in a flexible way. Methods are overridden to provide specific functionalities depending on the object's runtime type.
- **Abstraction:** Abstract classes and interfaces define templates for what game elements should do, hiding the complex implementations from the user and simplifying interactions between complex game components.
